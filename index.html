          <span>Hi ! </span><br /><br />
          This is Ali <br />
          I was born in September 1998 <br />
          I love learning and i love programming <br />
          In addition to programming, I am interested in other sciences such as
          : <br />
          theoretical physics, astrophysics, mathematics or professions such as
          photography <br />
          . <br />
          . <br />
          But I chose coding as my main path..

          At the age of 19, I became interested in coding <br />
          So without thinking I bought 4 programming training books : <br />
          <br />
          C &nbsp; &nbsp; C++ &nbsp; &nbsp; C# &nbsp; &nbsp; Visual bisic <br />
          . <br />. <br />
          I started with C++;&nbsp; I read half of that book and C++ is really
          beautiful <br />
          At least for me !
          <br />
          Needless to say, I still haven't read those three books..! <br />

          Despite these, things happened that took me away from programming

      <section class="c">
        <br />
        <article class="c">
          I don't want to write about why I couldn't continue. <br />
          The important thing is that when I started again, I knew that I should
          choose a field of programming <br />
          instead of just getting books !!

          After researching about various fields of programming <br />
          I decided to become a web developer <br />
          And this is my first project after learning
